    /* Condition when to show the link*/
    /* This is not a mandatory step*/
    /* if you want the button to be appeared on Page Layout always then you can skip this and start from Line:*/
    
    HYPERLINK("Link you want to redirect", "Name of the Link", target)
    

    HYPERLINK("Link you want to redirect",IMAGE("Image URL","label",height, width), target)

        HYPERLINK("https://www.google.com",  IMAGE("/resource/PK_LOGO", "Google",50,50) , "_self"),
        NULL
    )
    
    /*The URL canâ€™t contain JavaScript*/
    /*Use a relative link to link to Salesforce pages. If your full link is https://yourInstance./salesforce.com/00U/e, then its relative link is /00U/e.*/
